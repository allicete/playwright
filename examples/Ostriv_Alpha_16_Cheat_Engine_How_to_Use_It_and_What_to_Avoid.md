The cheat engine is not an official feature of the game, but rather a third-party tool that you can use with the help of Cheat Engine software. To enable it, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Cheat Engine from [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
2. Download the Ostriv cheat table from [here](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=7463). This is a file that contains the cheats for Ostriv.
3. Launch Ostriv and load your save game.
4. Launch Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon in the upper left corner.
5. Select Ostriv.exe from the process list and click on Open.
6. Click on File and then Load and select the Ostriv cheat table file that you downloaded.
7. You will see a list of cheats on the left side of Cheat Engine. Check the boxes or change the values of the ones that you want to use.

Some of the cheats that you can use are:

- All Resources: This will freeze the amount of resources that you have at a certain value. You can change this value by double-clicking on it.
- Add Resources: This will add a certain amount of resources to your inventory every time you activate it. You can change this amount by double-clicking on it.
- Freeze Time: This will stop the time from passing in the game.
- Speed Up Time: This will make the time pass faster in the game.
- No Fire: This will prevent any fire from spreading or damaging your buildings.
- No Disease: This will prevent any disease from affecting your population or livestock.
- No Crime: This will prevent any crime from occurring in your town.
- No Death: This will prevent any death from happening in your town.

However, using the cheat engine also comes with some risks and drawbacks. Some of them are:

- The cheat engine may not work with every version or patch of Ostriv. You may need to update or download a new cheat table file for it to work properly.
- The cheat engine may cause some bugs or glitches in the game. For example, some users have reported that using the Add Resources cheat can cause their livestock to multiply uncontrollably and die, resulting in lag and save corruption.
- The cheat engine may ruin your enjoyment or challenge of the game. Using cheats can make the game too easy or boring, and take away from the satisfaction of building your town from scratch.

Therefore, you should use the cheat engine at your own discretion and responsibility. If you decide to use it, make sure to back up your save files before doing so, and disable any cheats that you don't need or want. Also, remember that Ostriv is still in development and may change or improve over time, so you may not need to use cheats at all in the future.
